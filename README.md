## Hardware
ðŸ”¨        ðŸ”¨

### Camera: RaspberryPi Zero Camera Module (22Pin)
We connect the camera module to a raspberrypi zero for image capture.<br />



### Illumination: Three colors of LED arrays (RGB)
We used surface mounted LEDs with 120 degree angle (in RGB colors) as the light source. Three LED arrays (each contains 2 LEDs) are circly distributted under the silicone. <br /> 



### Silicone: Composed of transparent base, black markers and the reflective membrane <br />



#### Transparent base:
1. We 3D printed the mould (with resin) and laser-cut the acrylic sheet (placed at the bottom of the mould) for transparent silicone base manufacturing.
2. we use Solaris (part A and part B) with Shore A 15 and Slacker (used to increase softness) from vendor Smooth-onÂ® to produce the transparent elastomeric base. A ratio of 1:1:1 for each component has proven to be ideal for making an elastomeric base with the appropriate hardness. The mixture is then degassed and cured for 12 hours.  <br />



#### Black markers:
We painted markers on top surface of the transparent base with Silc-Pig (black colorant). The distance between each marker is around 1 mm.  <br />



#### Reflective membrane:
1. We dip a small amount of aluminum powder and spread it evenly upon the black markers.
2. we use aluminum powder, Psycho Paint (part A and part B) and Novocs Matte (silicone diluter) to produce the reflective membrane. A ratio of 1:5:5:30 for each component has proven to be ideal for making a moderate membrane. The mixture is degassed and then sprayed on top of the transparent base surface. The membrane is cured for 4 hours. <br />

## Software

### Step -1: set `config.yaml`
`camid` for `cv2.VideoCapture(camid)`.

`sample: from` for `{data_path}/sample_{sample_from}.jpg`.

`sample: to` for `{data_path}/sample_{sample_to}.jpg`.

`data_path` for `{data_path}`
### Step 0: run `pref_ref_and_sample.py`
    python pref_ref_and_sample.py -r -s


`-r` or `--ref` for capturing `{data_path}/ref.jpg`.

Click `left button` to take `ref.jpg`, you can click more than once until you are satiesfied. Then press `q` to exit or continue. 

`-s` or `--ref` for capturing `{data_path}/sample_xx.jpg`.

Click `left button` to take `sample_xx.jpg`. If `sample_to - sample_from` pictures are captured, it will terminate automatically. Or you can manually press `q` to exit in advance or continue. 

### Step 1: run `calibration_abberration.py`

Capture & save `ref.jpg` .

### Step 2: Get prepared for running `calibration.py`


#### 2.1 Measure `self.BallRad` eg: 3 
![avatar](/asset/BallRad.jpg)
#### 2.2 Measure `self.Pixmm` = $\frac{Length\ (mm)}{Pixel}$ 
##### 2.2.1 Capture & save `Pixmm.jpg`

Eg: 
![avatar](/asset/Pixmm.jpg)

##### 2.2.2 Get measurement of `mm`
Eg: mm = 3.40(mm)
![avatar](/asset/Pixmm_mm.jpg)

##### 2.2.3 Use `mesaure_Pixmm.py` to select 2 keypoints and calculate their distance (in `pixel`).

Click once on the first keypoint, then click once on the other keypoint, you will see an arrow linking 2 keypoints with their distance.
Eg: distance = 103.07764

##### 2.2.4 Calculate the Pixmm and fill it into `calibration.py`
In `line 13` of `calibration.py`:

`self.Pixmm` = $\frac{Length\ (mm)}{Pixel} = \frac{3.40}{103.0776}=0.03298$ 
#### 2.3 Capture & save 30 x `sample_xx.jpg`, from `sample_1.jpg` to `sample_30,jpg`. eg:
![avatar](/asset/sample_1.jpg)

#### 2.4 run `calibration.py`


### Step 3: run `test_poisson.py` or `Test0Cable.py`

Get reconstruction result.


## Improvements
ðŸ”¨Coming soon!ðŸ”¨
Thin plate spline for inpaint of markers?

Use model to map color to gradients.
